# tGeCoNet: a framework for constructing (t)emporal (Ge)ne (Co)-expression (Net)works

**tGeCoNet** is a python software package for constructing (real-world) temporal networks from age-related gene expression data (i.e., temporal gene co-expression networks).

Time-points modelling is inspired by our previous work on building synthetic interconnected networks: **GIN** (https://pietrocinaglia.github.io/gin).

**tGeCoNet** retrieves real-world gene expression data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) API V2 (https://gtexportal.org).

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To begin using tGeCoNet you have to follow these steps:

1. Install dependecies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Import tGeCoNet in your code:

- 2.1. Copy "tgeconet" folder into your workspace.

- 2.2. Import tGeCoNet in your code:

```
from tgeconet import TGECONET
```

3. Create an instance of **tGeCoNet**:

```
tgeconet = TGECONET(genes_of_interest:list, tissues_of_interest:list, threshold:float=0.05, verbose:bool=False):
```

4. Use the following methods:

- construct_temporal_network() -> list
- plot(with_labels:bool=True, savefig:str=None)

Additionally, the following method for testing was implemented:

- test(plot:bool=True, savefig:str=None)

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

**tGeCoNet** allows for constructing (real-world) temporal networks from age-related gene expression data

You can choose the method that best suits your data and use case.


# Constructing a Temporal Network from age-related gene expression data <a name="constructing"></a>

```
tgeconet = TGECONET(genes_of_interest:list, tissues_of_interest:list, threshold:float=0.05, verbose:bool=False):
temporal_network = tgeconet.construct_temporal_network(self)
```

# Plotting the temporal network <a name="plotting"></a>

'output_path' is the path where files will be saved.
Note that if 'savefig' is None, temporal network will only be shown.

```
tgeconet.plot(with_labels:True, savefig=output_path)
```


## Results <a name="results"></a>

The 'results' folder contains the results from tests conducted in our own experimentation and discussed in the academic article related to **tGeCoNet**
